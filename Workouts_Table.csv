We'll work for 50 seconds with a 10-second rest between exercises, completing each circuit twice. This glute-focused session includes various hip thrusts to engage all glute muscles, helping improve performance and prevent injuries. Grab heavier weights—one or two dumbbells, a barbell, or a kettlebell—and don’t forget a glute band and a towel for added comfort during hip thrusts. Let’s get to work and fire up those glutes!",Lower Body,1:37:21,290,pictures/legday.jpg,https://youtu.be/Z42K5PmpH7k?si=BnJYVpglClcUyQo1,https://youtu.be/L5v6Df__4l0?si=LFBubsqcGNik3z6_,NULL,NULL,LEG DAY WORKOUT with Dumbbells - Strong Legs,GLUTE WORKOUT with Dumbbells - Glutes Isolation,NULL,NULL,"So many of our favourite exercises in today’s leg workout! We will strengthen the quads, hamstrings and glutes as we perform a wide variety of lower body exercises using dumbbells and bodyweight as resistance in circuit format but as always the bodyweight portion isn’t easier!

Once we complete the circuits for 2 rounds, we then have just over 1 minute rest before beginning next circuit!","This glute focused workout is all about putting the work in! Packed with hip thrust variations, it is up to you to perform every single rep to the great range in motion possible. Hitting all of the muscles that make up the glutes, with assistance from the hamstrings and quads, this is a very demanding workout when you do it right! The ‘glutes’ are made up of many muscles, deep and superficial. We regularly hear about the more superficial muscles (gluteus maximus, medius and minimus) however the deep smaller muscles all have important roles to play in stabilising the pelvis and lateral rotation of legs. Why train the glutes? Strengthening the glute muscles can bring many benefits including reduced risk of dominance of over muscles such as hamstrings, quads and adductors, which can lead to imbalances and increased risk of injury; improvements to overall training performance (absorption of impact ie. jumping with more of the impact going to hips as apposed to knees); can alleviate lower back & knee pain associated with weak glutes; increases to bone density, improved posture and of course those physical goals. For this glute session, you will need a heavier weight(s), such as x1 dumbbell, x2 dumbbells, barbell, kettlebell! A comfortable chair/sofa/bench for hip thrusts is perfect but you can absolutely perform bridges in the mat if you prefer as with a yoga block for elevated lunges as you can perform regular with both feet on the ground! A glute band is needed and an option is a towel to place under weight to make hip thrusts more comfortable!",NULL,NULL,FALSE,FALSE
